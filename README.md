![Reva Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs3org/logos/efd3d2649478193e74f3de5a41247445941026b6/reva/logo.jpg)

Reva is an interoperability platform consisting of several daemons written in Go.
It acts as bridge between high-level clients (mobile, web, desktop) and the underlying storage (CephFS, EOS, local filesytems). 
It exports well-known APIs, like WebDAV, to faciliate access from these devices.
It also exports a high-performance gRPC API, codenamed [CS3APIS](https://buf.build/cs3org-buf/cs3apis), to easily integrate with other systems.
Reva is meant to be a high performant and customizable HTTP and GRPC server.

## Installation

Head to [Documentation](https://reva.link) for documentation or [download](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/releases) to get the latest available release.

## Documentation & Support

Read the [getting started guide](https://reva.link/docs/getting-started/) and the other feature guides.


## Contributing: Build and run it yourself

You need to have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.21 or higher), [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) installed. Some of these commands may require `sudo`, depending on your system setup.

```
# build
$ git clone https://github.com/cs3org/reva
$ cd reva
$ make # will compile and run unit tests
$ cmd/revad/revad --version
```

You can also read the [build from sources guide](https://reva.link/docs/getting-started/build-reva/) and the [setup tutorial](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/blob/master/docs/content/en/docs/tutorials/setup-tutorial.md).

## Contributing: Run tests

To run unit tests do:
`make test-go`

To run GRPC integration tests do:
`make test-integration`
You can get more verbose output with `ginkgo -v -r tests/integration/`.

To run EOS tests you need to have an up and running Docker system:
`make docker-eos-full-tests`
