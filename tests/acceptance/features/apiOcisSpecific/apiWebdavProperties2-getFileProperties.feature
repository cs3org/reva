@api
Feature: get file properties
  As a user
  I want to be able to get meta-information about files
  So that I can know file meta-information (detailed requirement TBD)

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  Scenario Outline: Do a PROPFIND of various file names
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content" to "<file_name>"
    When user "Alice" gets the properties of file "<file_name>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the properties response should contain an etag
    And the value of the item "//d:response/d:href" in the response to user "Alice" should match "/remote\.php\/<expected_href>/"
    Examples:
      | dav_version | file_name     | expected_href                        |
      | old         | /C++ file.cpp | webdav\/C\+\+%20file\.cpp            |
      | old         | /file #2.txt  | webdav\/file%20%232\.txt             |
      | old         | /file &2.txt  | webdav\/file%20&2\.txt               |
      | new         | /C++ file.cpp | dav\/files\/%username%\/C\+\+%20file\.cpp |
      | new         | /file #2.txt  | dav\/files\/%username%\/file%20%232\.txt  |
