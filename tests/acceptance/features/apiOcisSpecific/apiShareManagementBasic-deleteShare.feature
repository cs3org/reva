  # after fixing all issues delete this Scenario and use the one from oC10 core
  Scenario Outline: delete a share
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And user "Alice" has shared file "textfile0.txt" with user "Brian"
    When user "Alice" deletes the last share using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | ocs_status_code |
      | 1               | 100             |
      | 2               | 200             |
