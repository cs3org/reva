  @issue-37605
  # after fixing all issues make the oC10 scenario like this one, and delete this scenario
  Scenario: Get the mtime of a file inside a folder shared by public link using new webDAV version (run on OCIS)
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "testFolder"
    And user "Alice" has created a public link share with settings
      | path        | /testFolder               |
      | permissions | read,update,create,delete |
    When the public uploads file "file.txt" to the last shared folder with mtime "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT" using the new public WebDAV API
    Then as "Alice" file "testFolder/file.txt" should exist
    And as "Alice" the mtime of the file "testFolder/file.txt" should be "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT"
    And the mtime of file "file.txt" in the last shared public link using the WebDAV API should be "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT"
