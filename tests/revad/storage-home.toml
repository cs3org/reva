# This config file will start a reva service that:
# - uses the eoshome driver to serve users, jailed into their home (/home)
# - serves the home storage provider on grpc port 12000
# - serves http dataprovider for this storage on port 12001
#   - /data - dataprovider: file up and download
#
# The home storage will inject the username into the path and jail users into
# their home directory
