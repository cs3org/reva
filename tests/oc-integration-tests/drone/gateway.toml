# This config file will start a reva service that:
# - serves as a gateway for all CS3 requests
# - looks up the storageprovider using a storageregistry
# - looks up the authprovider using an authregistry
# - serves the gateway on grpc port 19000
# - serves http datagateway on port 19001
#   - /data - datagateway: file up and download

## users can be spread over multiple providers like this:

## the virtual /Shares folder of every user is routed like this:
## whenever the path matches the pattern /users/{{.CurrentUser.Id.OpaqueId}}/Shares we forward requests to the sharesstorageprovider
[grpc.services.storageregistry.drivers.spaces.providers."localhost:14000"]

#"localhost:14000" = {"mount_path" = "/shares", "space_type" = "share", "path_template" = "/shares/{{.Space.Name}}", "description" = "shares"}

## While public shares are mounted at /public logged in end will should never see that path because it is only created by the spaces registry when
## a public link is accessed.
