# While owncloud has only listed usernames at this endpoint CERN has
# been exposing more than just usernames. For owncloud deployments we
# can prefix the path to jail the requests to the correct CS3 namespace.
# In this deployment we mounted the owncloud storage provider at /oc. It
# expects a username as the first path segment.
# currently, only the desktop client will use this endpoint, but only if
# the dav.chunking capability is available
# TODO implement a path wrapper that rewrites `<username>` into the path
# layout for the users home?
# no, use GetHome?
# for eos we need to rewrite the path
# TODO strip the username from the path so the CS3 namespace can be mounted
# at the files/<username> endpoint? what about migration? separate reva instance

# similar to the dav/files endpoint we can configure a prefix for the old webdav endpoint
# we use the old webdav endpoint to present the cs3 namespace
# note: this changes the tree that is rendered at remote.php/webdav from the users home to the cs3 namespace
# use webdav_namespace = "/home" to use the old namespace that only exposes the users files
# this endpoint should not affect the desktop client sync but will present different folders for the other clients:
# - the desktop clients use a hardcoded remote.php/dav/files/<username> if the dav.chunkung capability is present
# - the ios ios uses the core.webdav-root capability which points to remote.php/webdav in oc10
# - the oc js sdk is hardcoded to the remote.php/webdav so it will see the new tree
# - TODO android? no sync ... but will see different tree
