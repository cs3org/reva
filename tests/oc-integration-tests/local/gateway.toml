# This config file will start a reva service that:
# - serves as a gateway for all CS3 requests
# - looks up the storageprovider using a storageregistry
# - looks up the authprovider using an authregistry
# - serves the gateway on grpc port 19000
# - serves http datagateway on port 19001
#   - /data - datagateway: file up and download

## this is the bare function of the registry: map path to spaceid

#"/users/marie" = {"spaceid" = "..."}
## obviously, we do not want to define a rule for every user and space, which is why we can define naming rules:
"/users" = {"address" = "localhost:11000", "space_type" = "personal", "path_template" = "/users/{{.Space.Owner.Id.OpaqueId}}", "description" = "personal spaces"}

## users can be spread over multiple providers like this:
#"/users/[0-9]" = {"address" = "localhost:11000", "space_type" = "personal", "path_template" = "/users/{{.Space.Owner.Id.OpaqueId}}", "description" = "personal spaces 0-9"}
#"/users/[a-f]" = {"address" = "localhost:11010", "space_type" = "personal", "path_template" = "/users/{{.Space.Owner.Id.OpaqueId}}", "description" = "personal spaces a-f"}

## the virtual /Shares folder of every user is routed like this:
## whenever the path matches the pattern /users/{{.CurrentUser.Id.OpaqueId}}/Shares we forward requests to the sharesstorageprovider
"/users/{{.CurrentUser.Id.OpaqueId}}/Shares" = {"address" = "localhost:14000", "space_type" = "share", "path_template" = "/users/{{.CurrentUser.Id.OpaqueId}}/Shares/{{.Space.Name}}", "description" = "shares"}

## An alternative would be used to mount shares outside of the users home:
#"/shares" = {"address" = "localhost:14000", "space_type" = "share", "path_template" = "/shares/{{.Space.Name}}", "description" = "shares"}

## While public shares are mounted at /public logged in end will should never see that path because it is only created by the spaces registry when
## a public link is accessed.
"/public" = {"address" = "localhost:13000",  "space_type" = "public", "path_template" = "/public", "description" = "public links"}
