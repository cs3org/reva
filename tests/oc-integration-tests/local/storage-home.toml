# This storage-home.toml config file will start a reva service that:

gatewaysvc = "localhost:19000"

# - authenticates grpc storage provider requests using the internal jwt token
# - authenticates http upload and download requests requests using basic auth
# - serves the home storage provider on grpc port 12000
# - serves http dataprovider for this storage on port 12001
#   - /data - dataprovider: file up and download
#
# The home storage will inject the username into the path and jail users into
# their home directory
