# This config file will start a reva service that:
# - serves as a gateway for all CS3 requests
# - looks up the storageprovider using a storageregistry
# - looks up the authprovider using an authregistry
# - serves the gateway on grpc port 19000
# - serves http datagateway on port 19001
#   - /data - datagateway: file up and download
