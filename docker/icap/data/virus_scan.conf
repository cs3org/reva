# To enable virus_scan service in c-icap, copy this file in c-icap
# configuration directory and add the following line at the end of
# c-icap.conf file:
#       Include virus_scan.conf
#

# Module: virus_scan
# Description:
#       This is an antivirus services for the c-icap ICAP server
#       This module add the following log formating codes for use with
#       the LogFormat configuration parameter:
#         %{virus_scan:virus}Sa  Prints the virus name or "-".
#         %{virus_scan:action}Sa Prints "passed" if the object scanned and no
#                                virus found, "blocked" if a virus found and
#                                object blocked, and "partiallyblocked" if a

#                                to the user.
#       Example:
#         LogFormat myVScanFmt "%tl, %>a %is %Ib %Ob %huo [Action: %{virus_scan:action}Sa] [Virus: %{virus_scan:virus}Sa]"
#         acl VSCAN service virus_scan
#         AccessLog /var/log/c-icap-access-vscan.log myVScanFmt VSCAN
#
#       The following additional formatting codes can be used with the service
#       templates (the VIRUS_FOUND, VIR_MODE_HEAD, VIR_MODE_PROGRESS,
#       VIR_MODE_TAIL and VIR_MODE_VIRUS_FOUND templates exist under the c-icap
#       templates directory):
#         %VVN  The virus name.
#         %VVV  The Antivirus name/version.
#         %VU   The HTTP url.
#         %VFR  The downloaded file requested name. For use with virelator mode.
#         %VFS  Expected http body data size (Content-Length header). For use
#               with virelator mode.
#         %VF   The name of the local file where the data stored. For use with
#               with virelator mode.
#         %VHS  An HTTP URL to get stored object. For use with virelator mode.
#               See also the VirHTTPUrl configuration parameter.
#         %VPR  Profile name (Exist only if virus_scan profiles are enabled).
#
# Example:
#       Service antivirus_module virus_scan.so
#       ServiceAlias  avscan virus_scan?allow204=on&sizelimit=off&mode=simple
#

# Load the virus_scan service:
Service antivirus_module virus_scan.so

#Add an alias to srv_clamav for compatibility with old service name
ServiceAlias srv_clamav virus_scan

# Add the alias avscan for virus_scan service. It is used by many
# ICAP based antivirus clients:
ServiceAlias  avscan virus_scan?allow204=on&sizelimit=off&mode=simple

# with the web location where the downloaded file stored.
