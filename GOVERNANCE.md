Governance
==========

REVA is governed by CERN for the benefit of the community. CERN
strives to make REVA a collaborative, open and transparent project to
ensure that everyone can contribute and have their say on the directions
of the project.

REVA governance is in general informal and we try to strike a balance
between processes and agreed upon standards vs. the wild west where
everyone do as they see fit. The governance model is intended to allow
that people progressively take larger and larger responsibilities with
support from the existing leadership.

These following sections define the different roles and responsibilities
in the project, define how decisions are taken and how people are
appointed to different roles. Overall, we expect every person who
participates in the project to adhere to our
`code-of-conduct`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

```The currrent governance model puts in words how the collaboration
currently works in practice today and sets a basic framework for how we
collaborate and take decisions in the project.

If the nature of the community or contributors changes this governance
model may be reviewed and changed if necessary.

Roles and responsibilities
--------------------------

The *product manager*, *coordinators*, *architects* and *maintainers*
(as defined below) make up the leadership of REVA. The leaders of
REVA are **service people** who:

-   take an active role in driving the project forward,
-   help newcomers as well as long-time contributors have great
    experience contributing to REVA,
-   help train members to progressive take larger responsibility in the
    project,
-   are role models for the remaining community.

**Roles:**

-   **Members**: Anyone using REVA.
-   **Contributors**: Anyone contributing to REVA (in it widest
    possible interpretation, i.e. not only programmers).
-   **Maintainers**: Anyone maintaining at least one repository.
    Maintainers are responsible for managing the issues and/or the code
    base of a repository according to REVA\'s standards.
-   **Architects**: Anyone maintaining multiple repositories (though max 10
    people). Architects are responsible for the overall REVA
    technical architecture as well as managing and training maintainers
    on their respective repositories.
-   **Coordinators**: Representatives of REVA based services that
    would like to coordinate their REVA development efforts with
    other services and provide input on the product road map.
-   **Product manager**: Overall responsible for REVA\'s vision,
    strategy and day-to-day management. Responsible for managing and
    training architects and coordinators.

Commit access on repositories are given to contributors, maintainers and
architects. Contributors can commit/merge to feature branches while only
maintainers and architects can commit/merge to master/maintenance
branches (meaning also only they can release new versions).

Decision making
---------------

We strive to take decisions openly and by consensus, though ultimately
CERN represented by the REVA product manager has the final say on all
decisions in the project. In particular this means that there is no
formal voting procedure for REVA.

**Leaders drive decision making**

The REVA product manager, architects, coordinators and maintainers as
the leaders of the project are responsible for driving decision making
in their respective domains.

Driving decision making means:

-   facilitating an open constructive discussion around a decision that
    matches the level of importance and impact of a decision,
-   striving for reaching consensus on a decision and ensuring relevant
    other members are aware and included on the decision,
-   ensuring decisions are in alignment with the overall REVA vision,
    strategy, architecture and standards,
-   coordinating the decision with the REVA leadership (product
    manager, architects and coordinators),
-   taking the decision.

**Leaders implement decisions**

Leaders are responsible for following up decisions they take by actual
implementation. Decision should not be considered final unless it is
actually implemented or documented publicly.

**Disagreements**

Leaders of the project should always strive for consensus. If that is
not possible the leader taking a decision should alert the REVA
product manager prior to taking the decision.

Members who are disagreeing with a decision may ask the product manager
to review a specific decision and possible change it.

Members who are disagreeing with the REVA product manager may
escalate the product manager\'s decision to their hierarchy at CERN.

Appointments
------------

The REVA product manager is appointed by CERN. Architects,
coordinators and maintainers are appointed by the REVA product
manager in collaboration with existing architects and coordinators.

Maintainers are appointed by the architects (e.g. a new REVA module)
or coordinators (e.g. a new special interest group).

Maintainers are appointed by the architects (e.g. a new REVA module)
or coordinators (e.g. a new special interest group).

In general, appointments are made in an informal way, and usually anyone
volunteering that have been showing commitment to the project will get
appointed. Any member can volunteer or suggest other members for roles.

**Revoking of appointed roles**

The product manager may revoke appointed roles of a member for reasons
such as (but not limitied to):

-   lack of activity
-   violations of the code of conduct
-   repeated infringements of the contribution, style or maintainer
    guides.

The product manager must give a warning to the member to allow them to
correct their behavior except in severe cases. Revoking roles should be
a last measure, and only serve the purpose to ensure that REVA has a
healthy community and collaboration based on our
[code-of-conduct]()

Working/Interest groups
-----------------------

Working/interest groups may be set up by the product manager on request
of any group of members who wish to address a particular area of REVA
(say Interoperable Clouds Working Group). Working/interest
groups help coordinate the overall vision, strategy and architecture of
a specific area of REVA. Each working/interest group must have chair
that reports to the product manager.
