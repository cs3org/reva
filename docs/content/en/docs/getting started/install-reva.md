  Install the Reva binaries to get up and running
---

Reva is written in Go and is shipped as a statically compiled single binary.
Releases are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/releases)
for different platforms.

Reva can also be compiled from source files. While more flexible, this approach may be complex
for a beginner. For more information, see [Build from sources](/docs/getting-started/build-reva).
