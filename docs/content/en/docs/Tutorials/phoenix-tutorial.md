  Connect Phoenix and Reva locally
---

This is a guide on how you can run both Pheonix and Reva locally in a dev environment. 
Phoenix is the new ownCloud frontend application and can be connected to Reva.

## 1. Clone the Phoenix and Reva repos

Clone the phoenix repo from https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix 

```
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix
```

Clone the reva repo from https://github.com/cs3org/reva 

```
git clone https://github.com/cs3org/reva
```

## 2. Build Reva
Go to your Reva folder 

```
cd reva
```

Now you need to build Reva by running the following commands (you need to be in the *reva* folder)

```
make deps
```

```
make
```

## 3. Set up Phoenix
Go to your Phoenix folder 

```
cd ../phoenix
```

Copy the *config.sample.json* file to *config.json* with the following command:

```
cp ../reva/examples/oc-phoenix/phoenix.oidc.config.json config.json
```


## 4. Run Phoenix and Reva
Now you need to run Phoenix and Revad (the Reva deamon). Follow these steps
from the *reva* folder:

```
cd examples/oc-phoenix/ && ../../cmd/revad/revad -dev-dir .
``` 

The Reva daemon (revad) should now be running.

In the Phoenix folder (open another terminal tab):

```
yarn watch-all
``` 

## 5. Open Phoenix 
You should now have both Reva and Phoenix up and running. You can access Phoenix on ```http://localhost:8300```.
Log in using username *einstein* and password *relativity*. 

## 6. Local changes
If you now do changes in Phoenix they will live changed on the opened tab *http://localhost:8300*.
You can check for example, change the name of one of the navItems in "default.js".

## 7. Enjoy your new Reva and Phoenix set up!
