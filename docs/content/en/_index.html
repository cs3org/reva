The Reva project aims to make cloud storage and application providers inter-operable through a common platform.</br>
The goal of the project is not to recreate other services, but to offer a straightforward way to connect existing services in a simple, portable
and scalable way. In order to do that, it leverages the **CS3 APIs**.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-cubes" title="Modularity" %}}
Almost any component of Reva can be swapped with your own components very easily: from HTTP middlewares and storage
adapters to gRPC interceptors and more. You only need to know **Go**!

{{% blocks/feature icon="fab fa-github" title="Always Open Source" %}}
Reva is developed on **GitHub** by multiple contributors who believe in the project. New contributors are always welcome to join!
Take a look at the **Community** page to reach us.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-project-diagram" title="Inter-operability" %}}
Using the **CS3 APIs** built on gRPC and Protocol Buffers, anyone can develop a component outside the 
Reva core in any language: polyglot inter-operability!

			CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is located at the heart of Europe, astride the Franco-Swiss border.
			 It is known not only for its flagship project (the Large Hadron Collider or LHC), but also for being the place
			 where Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989.

			Reva is used every day at CERN to power CERNBox's backend. CERNBox is CERN's cloud sync & storage solution and collaborative platform, which counts with more than 32,000 users and 10 PB of data.
