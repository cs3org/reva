# Installing REVA

REVA is written in Go and is shipped as a statically compiled single binary.
Releases are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/releases) page.

REVA can also be compiled from source files. While more flexible, this approach may be complex
for a beginner. For more information, see [Building REVA](./building-reva.md).
