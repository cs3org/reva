To compile the eos binding into go code:

protoc --go_out=. ./Rpc.proto
protoc ./Rpc.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:.


NOTE: we have to do this here in order to be sure that a compatible protoc compiler is used.
Having a CI somewhere compiling this does NOT guarantee that the same golang and protoc will be used,
and this has created lots of problems in the past
