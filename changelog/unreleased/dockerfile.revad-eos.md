Enhancement: Bring back multi-stage build to save on image size
- Use EOS 4.8.91 as base image
- Bring back multi-stage build
- Build revad on the eos 4.8.91 image due to missing dependency (`ld-musl-x86_64.so.1`, typical of alpine)
- Copy the resulting revad from the builder container

Resulting image size (unpacked on disk) is 2.59GB
- eos-all:4.8.91 is 2.47GB
- existing revad:latest-eos is 6.18GB
