Enhancement: Remove expired Link on Access

Since there is no background jobs scheduled to wipe out expired resources, for the time being public links are going to be removed on a "on demand" basis, meaning whenever there is an API call that access the list of shares for a given resource, we will check whether the share is expired and delete it if so.
