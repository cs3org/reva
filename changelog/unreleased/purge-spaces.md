Enhancement: Delete shares when purging spaces 

Implemented the second step of the two step spaces delete process.
The first step is marking the space as deleted, the second step is actually purging the space.
During the second step all shares, including public shares, in the space will be deleted.
When deleting a space the blobs are currently not yet deleted since the decomposedfs will receive some changes soon.
