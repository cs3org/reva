Enhancement: Strengthen OCM Client Security

Introduces several new security measures for the OCM client:

- Blocks requests to private or local network addresses.
- Limits the number of allowed redirects and validates target IPs to prevent redirection to private ranges.
- Adds configurable timeouts for connection establishment, TLS handshake, data read operations, and overall request duration.
- Enforces a maximum response size, halting reads after a specified byte limit.

All parameters are configurable through YAML or TOML config files on a per-service basis.
