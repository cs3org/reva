Enhancement: Map bad request and unimplement to http status codes

We now return a 400 bad request when a grpc call fails with an invalid argument status and a 501 not implemented when it fails with an unimplemented status. This prevents 500 errors when a user tries to add resources to the Share folder or a storage does not implement an action.
