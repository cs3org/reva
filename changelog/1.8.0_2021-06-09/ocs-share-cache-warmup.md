Enhancement: Add cache warmup strategy for OCS resource infos

Recently, a TTL cache was added to OCS to store statted resource infos. This PR
adds an interface to define warmup strategies and also adds a cbox specific
strategy which starts a goroutine to initialize the cache with all the valid
shares present in the system.
