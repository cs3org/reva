Enhancement: improve developer experience

Reva provided the option to be run with a single configuration file by using the 
-c config flag.

This PR adds the flag -dev-dir than can point to a directory containing multiple config
files. The reva daemon will launch a new process per configuration file.

Kudos to @refs.
